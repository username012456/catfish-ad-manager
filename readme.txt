== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't my Catfish ad show up? =

The Catfish plugin assumes you have the standard code wp_footer(); with in the footer of your template. This is where the Catfish code is inserted, so if it is not in the template it will not show up.

= Where can I get support? =

Support is provided either at the plugin home web site, by posting a comment, or post in the WordPress forums and use catfish as a tag. We will check their periodically for problems and questions.
